subject: [course name] – we’re starting in a month

Hello [first name]

I’m looking forward to welcoming you to [course name](link to course) next month.

The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, audio, discussions and assignments.  [try to give an idea of what learners are going to be looking at in the first week, and/or any more detail on the overall narrative of the course that hasn’t already been revealed on the course description page]

In the meantime, you may find it helpful to:
[suggest material to read or view – free material such as OERs, blogs or online videos, or links to books on Amazon (please use affiliate code for any Amazon links).- suggest things to think about ahead of the course, or reinforce any specific requirements for equipment etc]

There is still time to invite friends and colleagues to enrol on the course and take part alongside you. Having the support of people you know can really enrich the experience of studying online. As a reminder, the course page where they can enrol can be found [here](inline linked course URL)

There will be plenty of opportunity to interact with other learners within the course, which we strongly encourage. In the meantime, please take a moment to introduce yourself to your fellow learners in the discussion on the [course welcome page](link). You can also use the hashtag [#FLcoursehashtag](https://www.twitter.com/hashtag/FLcoursehashtag) to find and contribute to any discussions on social networks.

The course is due to begin on **Monday [day] [month]**. We will contact you again a week or so before the course starts, and will also send a welcome note as soon as we get underway.

If you have any queries or feedback in the meantime, I won’t personally be able to answer them, but please take a look at [FutureLearn’s extensive FAQ page](https://about.futurelearn.com/faq/).

Best wishes,
