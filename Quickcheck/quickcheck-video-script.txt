In this video, we are going to find out about a powerful
automated testing tool called QuickCheck.
This allows us to run random tests on our code, to check
it meets certain properties that we specify
QuickCheck comes as part of the Haskell platform, so you 
should already have access to it on your own machine.

It's a powerful testing technique, used in the software
industry  (examples ...)



OK - suppose we want to implement a substitution cipher - 
let's do Caesar's cipher - where we encode letters by moving
them a certain number of spaces along in the alphabet

import Data.Char

wrongcipher :: [Char] -> Int -> [Char]
wrongcipher [] shift = []
wrongcipher (c:cs) shift 
  | isLetter(c)&&isAscii(c)  = let shiftedChar = ord(c) + shift
                               in chr(shiftedChar):(wrongcipher cs shift)
  | otherwise = c:(wrongcipher cs shift)


great, we have shifted the letters along the right number of places...

e.g. let's try encipher "hello" 1
encipher "veni vidi vici" 4

(I know , I know,  this isn't correct code because it doesn't wrap around the alphabet, 
but bear with me for now...)

now - for the decipher, we want to shift letters back the same number of places - 

let decipher = \x y-> (encipher x (-y))

Now, we want to check this works - (check).
Rather than devise a number of test cases, we will randomly generate input data 
(test case data) and check whether the property holds (an invariant)

for all x, y . decipher((encipher x y) y) = x

first we import the QuickCheck module

import Test.QuickCheck

then we ask to check our invariant

quickCheck ((\s->(\n -> ((decipher (wrongcipher s n) n)==s))) :: [Char] -> Int -> Bool)

This is the call to quickcheck - note that we have to write a lambda expression that takes two arguments - the string s and the int n - we need to supply the types for these, then 


OK - run quickcheck
(defaults to 100 tests) - 

and we can trace them

run more than 100 ...

doesn't guarantee the code works - (Dijkstra quote) - but not a bad way to test...



encipher :: [Char] -> Int -> [Char]
encipher [] shift = []
encipher (c:cs) shift 
  | isUpper(c) = let shiftedChar = ord(c) + shift
                     adjustedChar = if shiftedChar > ord('Z') then
shiftedChar-26 else shiftedChar
                 in chr(adjustedChar):(encipher cs shift)
  | isLower(c) = let shiftedChar = ord(c) + shift
                     adjustedChar = if shiftedChar > ord('z') then
shiftedChar-26 else shiftedChar
                 in chr(adjustedChar):(encipher cs shift)
  | otherwise = c:(encipher cs shift)
