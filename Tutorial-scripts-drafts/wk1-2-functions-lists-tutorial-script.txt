Functions

Defining a function

In Haskell, many functions are pre-defined in a standard library called the Prelude.
We have already encountered some of them in the previous tutorial, e.g. abs, max and min.

But the essence of functional programming is defining your own functions to solve your problems!

A function is defined by an equation.

f = \x -> x+1  -- lambda function
-- or
f x = x+1 -- named function


The left hand side of the equation looks like a variable – and that’s what it is
The right hand side is an expression that uses the local variables listen in parentheses and defines the result of the expression.
Function application



  f 3

Functions with several arguments

Define a function with three arguments:

add3nums = \x y z -> x + y + z

To use it, e.g.

  10 + 4* add3nums 1 2 3

Lists


A list is a single value that contains several other values.
Syntax: the elements are written in square parentheses, separated by commas.
['3', 'a']
[2.718, 50.0, -1.0]

Function returning several results

Actually, a function can return only one result.
However, lists allow you to package up several values into one object, which can be returned by a function.
Here is a function minmax that returns both the smaller and the larger of two numbers:
minmax = \x y -> [min x y, max x y]
minmax 3 8  -- > [3,8]
minmax 8 3  -- > [3,8]
The elements are evaluated

You can write a constant list

mylist = [2,4,6,8]
But the elements can be expressions, which are evaluated. Suppose you define:

answer = 42
yourlist = [7, answer+1, 7*8]
Then

  yourlist
-- >
  [7, 43, 56]
Constructing lists

Append: the (++) operator

The (++) operator takes two existing lists, and gives you a new one containing all the elements.
The operator is pronounced append, and written as two consecutive + characters.
  [23, 29] ++ [48, 41, 44]
-- >
  [23, 29, 48, 41, 44]
A couple of useful properties:

The length of the result is always the sum of the lengths of the original lists.
If xs is a list, then []++xs=xs=xs++[].
Sequences

Sometimes it’s useful to have a sequence of numbers.
In standard mathematical notation, you can write 0,1,…,n.
Haskell has a sequence notation for lists.
Write the sequence in square brackets, with start value, the operator .., and end value.
[0 .. 5] - > [0,1,2,3,4,5]
[100 .. 103] - > [100,101,102,103]
The elements are incremented by 1
Sequences aren’t limited to numbers

There are many enumerable types where there is a natural way to increment a value.
You can use sequences on any such type.
Characters are enumerable: there is a successor to each character.
[’a’ .. ’z’] - > [’a’,’b’,’c’,’d’,’e’,’f’,’g’,’h’,’i’,’j’,’k’, ’l’,’m’,’n’,’o’,’p’,’q’,’r’,’s’,’t’,’u’,’v’, ’w’,’x’,’y’,’z’]
[’0’ .. ’9’] - > [’0’,’1’,’2’,’3’,’4’,’5’,’6’,’7’,’8”9’] is a list of characters (which happen to be the digit characters)
[0 .. 9] - > [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] is a list of numbers
List comprehensions

A list comprehension is a high level notation for specifying the computation of a list
The compiler automatically transforms a list comprehensions into an expression using a family of basic functions that operate on lists
List comprehensions were inspired by the mathematical notation set comprehension.
Examples of set comprehensions:
A set obtained by multiplying the elements of another set by 3 is {3×x|x←{1,…,10}}.
The set of even numbers is {2×x|x←N}.
The set of odd numbers is {2×x+1|x←N}.
The cross product of two sets A and B is {(a,b)|a←A,b←B}.
Examples of list comprehensions

  [3*x | x <- [1..10]]
-- >
  [3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30]
  [2*x | x <- [0..10]]
-- >
  [0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
  [2*x + 1 | x <- [0..10]]
-- >
  [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21]
  [[a,b] | a <- [10,11,12] , b <- [20,21]]
-- >
  [[10,20],[10,21],[11,20],[11,21],[12,20],[12,21]]
Operating on lists

Indexing a list

We can index a list by numbering the elements, starting with 0.
Thus a canonical form of a list with n elements is [x0,x1,..xn−1].
The !! operator takes a list and an index, and returns the corresponding element.
[5,3,8,7]  !! 2    -- > 8
[0 .. 100]  !! 81  -- > 81
['a'..'z'] !! 13  -- > 'n'
  
If the index is negative, or too large, undefined is returned.
For robust programming, we need to ensure either that all expressions are well defined, or else that all exceptions are caught and handled.
Later, we’ll look at how to follow both of those approaches.
head and tail

There are standard library functions to give the head of a list (its first element) or the tail (all the rest of the list)
The result of applying head or tail to the empty list is undefined.
head :: [a] -> a
head [4,5,6] -- > 4
tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail [4,5,6] -- > [5,6]
Recommendation: avoid using head and tail, because you want to avoid undefined values so your programs are robust. Unless you’re doing something really sophisticated, you’re better off with pattern matching. There are, however, some cases where they are appropriate.
